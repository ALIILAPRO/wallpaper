This is a GitHub repository for a Telegram bot that downloads random photos from API and saves their file IDs in a SQLite database file.

## Usage

To use the `pic.db` file, you first need to have a basic understanding of SQLite and its command-line interface. You can download and install SQLite from the official website (https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or use a GUI tool like SQLiteStudio (https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
